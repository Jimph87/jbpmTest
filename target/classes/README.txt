This project shows a business process which interacts create User tasks for different group of users.
The main idea of the example is to show how task lists works. Notice that there are two Tasks that can be implemented
with service connectors, but for sake of simplicity these tasks are just Script Task. 
A good exercise for you, if you are interested to learn about the tool is to configure those tasks to 
interact with external services. 

For more information about this example you can take a look at this blog post:
